# Speakers

We'd love to have you present at the [Cleveland R User Group][meetup]. The
guidelines below are to help you prepare. If you have any additional questions,
please open an Issue in this repo or directly email the co-organizers.

## Topics

While we of course welcome talks that specifically involve the use of R, we are
also happy to have talks on any topic that would be of interest to R users. Thus
anything related to statistics, data science, etc. is in scope.

## Expertise

You do **not** need to be an expert to present on a topic. In fact, it may even
be better if you just learned about a topic because it is fresh in your mind and
you can still remember what it was like to not know anything about it.

## Format

Our meetups are typically the 4th Wednesday of each month. They start at 6 pm
local time (US Eastern, America/New_York, alternates between UTC-4 and UTC-5).
They are virtual via Zoom, and if you consent, we record the talk and post the
recording to our [YouTube channel][youtube] a few days later.

Here is the timeline of a standard meetup:

* Wait ~5 minutes for members to join Zoom call
* Welcome, announcements
* Start recording, co-organizer will introduce you
* Your presentation (30-60 minutes)
* Q&A

## Presentation lengths

We're flexible with the presentation length. If you don't want to be the only
presenter, you can also split time with a second speaker or participate in one
of our lightning talk meetups.

Type            | Length (min)
--------------- | ------------
Single speaker  | 30-60
Two speakers    | 10-20
Lightning talks | 5-10

## Technology

We use [meetup.com][meetup] to announce our events and handle registration. The
Zoom link for the meetup is only available to members that have registered for
the event (which requires membership in our user group). If you are an external
speaker and prefer not to join our group, please let a co-organizer know, and we
are happy to instead send you a calendar invite with the Zoom link.
